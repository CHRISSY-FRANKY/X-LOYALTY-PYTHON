# X-LOYALTY-PYTHON

The pythonic version of [X-LOYALTY-C-SHARP](https://github.com/CHRISSY-FRANKY/X-LOYALTY-C-SHARP) but instead of serving a gui it will serve a website to hopefully deploy in the near future.

## TO DO
- UPDATE positioning of username-node(s) in realtime to create a particle swarm animation effect
- UPDATE advanced-statistics.html by enabling a username popup while hovering over a username-node
- UPDATE the runtime lifecycle of the application with reduced/single sign in prompt
- FIX the resizing to be consistent throughout the runtime lifecycle of the application
- idk etc
