# X-LOYALTY-PYTHON

The pythonic version of [X-LOYALTY-C-SHARP](https://github.com/CHRISSY-FRANKY/X-LOYALTY-C-SHARP) but instead of serving a gui it will serve a website to hopefully deploy in the near future.

## BE AWARE

the following/followers usernames scraping duration will take longer the more followers/following you have and the more latency your internet service provider offers

i do not intend in paying [hundreds/thousands of dollars](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/products/pro) a month just to send an api request to x.com's servers to obtain a specific user's followers/followings to reduce the duration mentioned above to less than a few seconds
